# 100 Days of Code Challenge

- Personal challenge to code 1 hour a day in either JavaScript of Python to continue working on coding skills and DSA/interview prep.

## Week 1

- 4.4 - Today I worked on a DSA challenge from LeetCode using JavaScript. I utilized a traditional for loop to run through the array and sum up the elements. I learned to work on solving the challenge by talking out each step and what I though that step would return in order to break down the challenge into smaller pieces. I mainly struggled with the initial assumption that I wanted to add the current element to the next element (i + 1), instead of adding the current element to the previous sum (num[i] += (i - 1)).
