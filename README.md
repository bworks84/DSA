# 100 Days of Code Challenge

- Personal challenge to code 1 hour a day in either JavaScript of Python to continue working on coding skills and DSA/interview prep.

## Week 1

- 4.4 - Today I worked on a DSA challenge from LeetCode using JavaScript. I utilized a traditional for loop to run through the array and sum up the elements.
- 4.5 - Today I worked on a challenge that helped me iterate over and sum up the values in a 2-D array. I used the forEach method that helped me loop through each dimension of the array and create variables for each element for easier organization.
